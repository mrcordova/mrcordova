## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I've been enjoying learning about the ins and outs of full stack development. I started my journey going through the new [MDN front-end developer curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/) which helped me appricate the basics of all web projects: HTML, CSS and JS. After finishing the MDN curriculm, I began creating front-end projects from [front-end mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) with pure HTML, CSS, JS, Node and SQL to gain a better understanding of web development and aqcuire hands-on experencie. I continue to work on personal projects and learn new techonologies.

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in front-end, back-end or full stack web development, ideally writing in JS or SQL. I'd especially love to work on a team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
