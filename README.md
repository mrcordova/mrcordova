## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying learning the ins and outs of full-stack development. I started my journey by going through the new [MDN Front-End Developer Curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/), which helped me appreciate the basics of all web projects: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After completing the MDN curriculum, I began creating front-end projects from [Front-End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)  using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL to gain a deeper understanding of web development and acquire hands-on experience. I continue to work on personal projects and learn new technologies.

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development, ideally working with JavaScript and SQL. I'd especially love to join a team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
