## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer with a focus on full-stack web development. My journey started with the [MDN Front-End Developer Curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/), which solidified my understanding of core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there, I honed my skills by building front-end projects on [Front-End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) and expanded into back-end development using Node.js and SQL, gaining hands-on experience in creating functional and user-friendly web applications.

Iâ€™m eager to join a team where I can apply my technical skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL to solve real-world problems and deliver impactful solutions. My goal is to continue learning, collaborate effectively, and contribute to meaningful projects. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking for a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer ready to hit the ground running!
